## Interpreting DTCs

### The first character (letter)

OBD-II codes start with a letter that denotes the part of the vehicle that has a fault.  

*   P – Powertrain. Includes engine, transmission, and associated accessories.
*   C – Chassis. Covers mechanical systems and functions: steering, suspension, and braking.
*   B – Body. Parts that are mainly found in the passenger compartment area.
*   U – Network & vehicle integration. Functions that are managed by the onboard computer system.  
      
      
    
    ### The second character (number)
    
    The first letter is followed by a number, usually 0 or 1.
    
    *   0 – Standardized (SAE) code, also known as generic code (sometimes called global)
    *   1 – Manufacturer-specific code (sometimes called enhanced)
    
    ### The third character (number)
    
    For powertrain codes, this number tells you which vehicle subsystem has a fault. There are eight:
    
    *   0 – Fuel and air metering and auxiliary emission controls
    *   1 – Fuel and air metering
    *   2 – Fuel and air metering – injector circuit
    *   3 – Ignition systems or misfires
    *   4 – Auxiliary emission controls
    *   5 – Vehicle speed control, idle control systems, and auxiliary inputs
    *   6 – Computer and output circuit
    *   7 – Transmission
    
      
    You may also see an A, B, or C, which can refer to hybrid propulsion systems.
    
    For other families of codes, refer to the definitions provided by your manufacturer.
    
    ### The fourth and fifth characters (number)
    
    The final piece of a DTC is a number that defines the exact problem that you’re experiencing. It can be a number between zero and 99.
    
    Here’s an example of a complete code:
    
    P0782 means powertrain, generic, transmission, 2-3 shift malfunction.
